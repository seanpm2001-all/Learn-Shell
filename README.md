### Learning Shell (bash) (programming language)

I know a decent amount about the UNIX shell scripting program, but I haven't tested all examples yet. I have learned all of this in my time using Linux since 2020 July 9th.

#### Hello World in Shell

A Hello World program in BASH shell is very simple, and goes like this:

```shell
echo ("Hello world");
```

#### Waiting in Shell

You can delay actions of commands by the second in Shell, like so:

```shell
echo ("Resuming in 5 seconds");
wait 5;
echo ("Resuming in 10 seconds");
wait 10;
echo ("You have wasted 15 seconds of your life. Congratulations!");
```

#### Exiting in Shell

You can force a program to exit after you are done with its script in Shell. Some languages like C support this as well. This is how to do so:

```shell
echo ("This program will close in 10 seconds");
wait 10;
exit;
```

#### Comments in Shell

Comments in C# are identical to comments in Python, Perl, and other languages.

```shell
# This is a single line comment
# Shell does not support multi-line comments as far as I know
```

#### Shebang in Shell

Shell has a Shebang that I have not fully memroized yet. It allows the easy detection of Shell scripts, even if the file has no file extension.

```shell
#!/bin/sh
echo ("This is a Shell script");
wait 3;
exit;
```

#### Break keyword in Shell

```shell
break;
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Functions in Shell

Shell supports functions, they are very easy to define. This is how to make one:

```shell
aFunctionalFunction () { 
   echo ("This is a functioning functional function");
   wait 3;
   break;
}
```

#### Returning a function in Shell

This is an expansion to the previous program. Shell supports the `return` keyword, allowing for the return of functions.

```shell
aFunctionalFunction () { 
   echo ("This is a functioning functional function");
   wait 3;
   break;
}
return aFunctionalFunction();
```

#### Reading from dev/full in Shell

This example comes from my Linux setup repository. It goes over reading from the `dev/full` device, an empty drive that is used for the purpose of testing programs and what they do when the system has no memory.

```shell
#!/bin/sh
# Start of script
echo "dev/full > TESTING.sh - Testing the dev/full device"
wait 1 # 1 second pause for dramatic reading
echo "From Wikipedia: dev/full"
wait 1 # Another 1 second pause for dramatic reading
echo "In Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD /dev/full or the always full device is a special file that always returns the error code ENOSPC (meaning \"No space left on device\") on writing, and provides an infinite number of zero bytes to any process that reads from it (similar to /dev/zero). This device is usually used when testing the behaviour of a program when it encounters a \"disk full\" error."
wait 12 # Gives the user plenty of time to read the text before continuing
echo "The following example is modified from the primary Wednesday, 2021 October 13th edits of this page."
wait 4 # Gives the user time to read the text before continuing
# Testing responses for programs when the user has no available memory
echo "0" > /dev/full # Is it safe to add a 3rd backslash, like so?: /dev/full/
wait 3 # SUSPENSE! (mostly if it doesn't work)
echo "Intended response:"
wait 1 # 1 second pause for dramatic reading
echo "bash: echo: write error: No space left on device"
wait 1 # Yet another 1 second pause for dramatic reading
echo "I trimmed out the 'hello world' and replaced it with a single zero to indicate the lowest possible value and data size (other than 0 bits) being fed to dev/null"
wait 5
break
exit
# File info
# File type: SHell script file (*.sh)
# File version: 1 (2021, Wednesday, October 13th at 9:40 pm)
# Line count (including blank lines and compiler line): 27
# End of script
```

#### FreeDesktop communication in Shell

##### Reading from upower in FreeDesktop in Shell

Get information on the battery via FreeDesktop.ORG on Linux (tested successfully on Ubuntu 20.04)

```shell
upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0
```

#### Calendar in Shell

##### 1752 Calendar reform in Shell

There is a feature in the Shell `cal` (calendar) command, where the year 1752 does a historically accurate change. For context, in 1752, the British Empire and its territories switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. To adjust the days for this change, September 3rd to September 13th 1752 were skipped for this year. This was included into the Calendar command and was pointed out by its developer, although some may consider it a bug, as this calendar change did not happen in all nations (some countries adopted the Gregorian Calendar before or after 1752)

```shell
#!/bin/sh
# In 1752, the British Empire and its territories switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. To adjust the days for this change, September 3rd to September 13th 1752 were skipped for this year
# This was included into the Calendar command and was pointed out by its developer, although some may consider it a bug, as this calendar change did not happen in all nations (some countries adopted the Gregorian Calendar before or after 1752)
cal 1752
cal 9 1752
```

##### UNIX 32 bit Epoch calendar in Shell

This program needs to be optimized, but it intends to show the calendar in every year supported on a 32 bit UNIX system (1970-2038)

```shell
#!/bin/sh
cal 1970 # Start of the UNIX epoch
cal 1971
cal 1972
cal 1973
cal 1974
cal 1975
cal 1976

cal 2037
cal 2038 -1 # Y2K38 bug on 32 bit UNIX occurs on January 19th 2038 at 03:14:07 UTC (I am unsure if this line will crash a 32 bit UNIX Machine, as -1 goes past January 19th)
# cal 2039
# cal 2040
# There has to be a simpler way to do this, possibly similar to this:
# cal 1970 to 2037, 2038 -1 # pseudocode
```

#### Forkbombs in Shell

**WARNING!** - This program is malicious, and is here for educational purposes. Make sure to run this in a virtual machine only. If you run it on your main system, it will bring your system down. If you place it in the startup folder, it will destroy your system installation.

This is a classic Shell forkbomb, a process that will keep duplicating itself until your computer runs out of resources and crashes.

```shell
fork() {
    fork | fork &
}
fork
```

I have to run this command on my first and second Linux laptops every single time I turn it on or restart it, as the process `tracker-miner-fs` keeps getting stuck, and mining the CPU + using a gigabyte of RAM until I kill it:

```shell
tracker reset --hard
```

After it gives you a warning, type `y` and hit `enter`

##### Changing the GNOME clock in Shell

**Enabling seconds on the clock:**

```

#### Other knowledge of BASH Shell

1. Shell uses the `*.sh` file extension

2. Shell is a curly bracket and semicolon language

3. **BASH** stands for **B**ourne **A**gain **SH**ell

4. Shell support is default in most Linux and BSD distributions (notably Ubuntu, Arch, MacOS, Manjaro, Fedora, etc.), but is not supported by default in Microsoft Windows

5. No other knowledge of the BASH shell programming language
